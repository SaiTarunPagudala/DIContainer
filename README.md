# DIContainer
This project implements a Dependency Injection (DI) Container that manages the registration and resolution of dependencies as either singleton or transient instances.

Features
Singleton Registration: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and shared across the application.
Transient Registration: Creates a new instance of a class every time it is requested.
Testing
The project includes a dedicated test suite that runs various scenarios to demonstrate the functionality of the DI Container. By executing these tests, you can understand how the container handles different registration scenarios and ensures the correct behavior of your dependencies.

Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Run the test suite to see the DI Container in action and verify its functionality.
